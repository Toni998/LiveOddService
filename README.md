Live Scoreboard

-Live scoreboard is a simple library which simulates scoreboard for representing ongoing matches.<br />
-Live scoreboard can start, update, finish and output football matches.<br />

Functionalities : <br />
- Starting football match<br />
- Checking if teams are participating world cup <br />
- Checking if given team pair is a valid one <br />
- Updating absolute score<br />
- Getting summary for all matches and apply sorting.<br />

The scoreboard supports the following operations:
1. Start a new match, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
This should capture following parameters:
a. Home team
b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
team score.
3. Finish match currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score. The matches with the
same total sc

Architecture : <br />
FootballMatch - class representing a football match contain information about football match and functions for retrieving data for selected match<br />
LiveScoreboard - Simulation of scoreboard for live football matches which is responsible for processing data about football match for starting, updating, finish football match.<br />
LiveOddServiceTest - class where all tests are implemented. Application is implemented in TDD design.<br />
Main - main program where the football matches are defined and applied sorting for getting summary as in the example above.<br />
SummaryFactory - class used for DI container<br />

Testing is done with Junit5 framework

Test overview :
- Participate world cup - responsible for checking is the provided team/team pair allowed to participate world cup.
- Start football match - responsible for starting football match. Checks if provided names are correct and is initial score is 0-0. No validation for participation is done
- Start football match - already started match - responsible for starting already started match. Throws exception is match is already started.
- Start football match - valid names - responsible for starting match with valid names and team pairs. Asserting true is expected.
- Start football match - invalid names - responsible for starting match with invalid names, throws exception  or false if pairs or provided team name is not correct.

How to run ?<br />
- Clone LiveOddService repository.<br />
- Open in desired IDE (implemented in IntelliJ)<br />
- Add dependencies<br />
- For running tests -> open LiveOddServiceTest and run it<br />
- For running main program and checking summary from requirements -> run main program<br />

Enjoy !
