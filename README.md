Architecure : 
FootballMatch - class representing a football match containg informations about football match and funtions for retriving data for selected match
LiveScoreboard - Simulation of scoreboard for live football matches which is responsible for processing data about football match for starting, updating, finish football match.
LiveOddServiceTest - class where all tests are implemented. Applicatipn is implemented in TDD design.
Main - main program where the football matches are defined and applied sorting for getting summary as in the example above.
SummaryFactory - class used for DI container

Testing is done with Junit5 framework

Test ovreview :
- Participate world cup - responsible for checking is the provided team/team pair allowed to participate world cup.
- Start football match - responsible for starting football match. Cheks if provided names are correct and is inital score is 0-0. No validation for partcipation is done

-For running tests -> open LiveOddServiceTest and run it<br />
-For running main program and checking summary from requirements -> run main program<br />

Enjoy !
